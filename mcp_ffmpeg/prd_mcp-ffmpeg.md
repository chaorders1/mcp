# Product Requirements Document
## Claude FFmpeg Command Wrapper (MCP-based)

### Overview
A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude to execute FFmpeg commands on macOS systems through natural language requests. This service will act as a bridge between Claude's natural language processing capabilities and FFmpeg's command-line interface.

### Problem Statement
Users want to perform media conversions and manipulations through Claude but currently cannot due to Claude's inability to directly execute system commands. Additionally, FFmpeg's command-line syntax can be complex and intimidating for non-technical users.

### Objectives
- Enable Claude to understand and execute media conversion requests
- Simplify FFmpeg usage through natural language processing
- Provide secure and controlled access to FFmpeg functionality
- Maintain audit logs of all media operations
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback

### Target Users
- Claude users who need to perform media conversions
- Content creators working directly with Claude
- Users who find FFmpeg command-line interface challenging
- Developers integrating media conversion capabilities into their Claude workflows

### Core Features

#### 1. Media Conversion Operations
- Audio conversion (mp4→mp3, wav→mp3, etc.)
- Video conversion (mov→mp4, avi→mp4, etc.)
- Audio extraction from video
- Basic video operations (trim, merge, etc.)
- Support for common media formats

#### 2. MCP Server Implementation
- FFmpeg command builder service
- Input validation and sanitization
- Progress monitoring and reporting
- Resource management and cleanup
- Error handling and reporting

#### 3. Natural Language Interface
- Command pattern recognition
- Parameter extraction
- Format validation
- User intent confirmation
- Helpful error messages

#### 4. Security Features
- Input validation and sanitization
- Working directory isolation
- Resource usage limits
- File permission management
- Operation whitelisting

### Technical Requirements

#### MCP Server
```python
# Key components needed:
- FFmpeg wrapper class
- Command builder service
- Progress monitoring
- Error handler
- Resource manager
```

#### Integration Points
- Claude natural language interface
- Local FFmpeg installation
- File system access
- Progress reporting

#### Supported Commands (Phase 1)
1. Basic Conversion
   - "convert [input] to [output format]"
   - "extract audio from [video]"
   - "compress [media file]"

2. Advanced Operations
   - "trim [input] from [start] to [end]"
   - "merge [file1] and [file2]"
   - "adjust volume of [file] to [level]"

### User Experience

#### Command Flow
1. User issues natural language command to Claude
2. Claude interprets command and validates intent
3. MCP server builds FFmpeg command
4. Command execution with progress reporting
5. Result verification and user notification

#### Error Handling
- Input format validation
- FFmpeg execution errors
- Resource availability
- Permission issues
- Invalid operations

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1 (MVP)
- Basic media conversion operations
- Essential format support
- Simple progress reporting
- Basic error handling

#### Phase 2
- Advanced operations
- Batch processing
- Enhanced progress monitoring
- Detailed logging
- Operation history

#### Phase 3
- Custom operation templates
- Operation scheduling
- Advanced error recovery
- Performance optimizations
